# Summary

<!-- A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience. -->

`LogoClim` is a NetLogo model designed to simulate and visualize climate conditions, providing a powerful tool for integrating historical and projected climate data into agent-based models. Its primary goal is to improve the reproducibility and accessibility of climate-based simulations.

The model uses raster data to represent climate variables such as temperature and precipitation over time. It includes historical data (1960–2021) and future climate projections (2021–2100) based on global climate models under various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs, @oneill2017) .

Climate data for `LogoClim` is sourced from [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/) [@fick2017a], which offers high-resolution data, as fine as ~1 km², interpolated from weather stations worldwide.

It is freely available on the CoMSES Network and on GitHub.

# Statement of need

<!-- A Statement of need section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software and places it in the context of related work. -->

The lack of reproducibility is a major concern in science [@baker2016], including in computational research [@peng2011]. This challenge is particularly relevant for agent-based models (ABMs), which are widely used to simulate complex phenomena [@railsback2019a]. One effective strategy to address this issue is the development of open, specialized tools that promote transparency, standardization, and reusability across research groups. This is why `LogoClim` was created.

The `LogoClim` model was developed to be integrated with other models through the LevelSpace (`ls`) extension for NetLogo. This extension supports the parallel execution of multiple models and facilitates data exchange between them, making it especially valuable for agent-based simulations that incorporate climate data to investigate ecological or environmental dynamics.

<!-- Mention (if applicable) a representative set of past or ongoing research projects using the software and recent scholarly publications enabled by it. -->

The model was created as part of the [Sustentarea](https://www.fsp.usp.br/sustentarea/)'s Research and Extension Center project named *Global Syndemic project*, whose goal is to evaluate the impac of climate change on the health and nutrition of brazillian children under five years old [@carvalho2023a]. `LogoClim` is used as a submodel for an ABM designed to be used by researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to better understand the potential consequences of climate change on vulnerable populations.
