# Summary

`LogoClim` is a [NetLogo](https://www.netlogo.org) model for simulating and visualizing global climate conditions. It allows researchers to integrate high-resolution climate data into agent-based models, supporting reproducible research in ecology, agriculture, environmental sciences, and other fields that rely on climate data.

The model utilizes raster data to represent climate variables such as temperature and precipitation over time. It incorporates historical data (1951-2024) and future climate projections (2021-2100) derived from global climate models under various Shared Socioeconomic Pathways ([SSPs](https://climatedata.ca/resource/understanding-shared-socio-economic-pathways-ssps/)) [@oneill2017]. All climate inputs come from [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/), a widely used source of high-resolution, interpolated climate datasets based on weather station observations worldwide [@fick2017], available for academic and other non-commercial use.

`LogoClim` follows the FAIR Principles for Research Software [@barker2022] and is openly available on the [CoMSES Network](https://www.comses.net/codebases/bccd451f-76a4-408a-85fd-c5024359ba9a/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/sustentarea/logoclim). @fig-logoclim-interface-1 and @fig-logoclim-interface-2 illustrate the model's interface and functionality. See the [`Logônia`](https://github.com/sustentarea/logonia) model [@vartanian2025g] for an example of its integration into a full NetLogo simulation.

# Statement of need

The lack of reproducibility is a major concern in science [@baker2016], including in computational research [@peng2011]. This challenge is particularly relevant for agent-based models, which are used to simulate complex phenomena [@grimm2006a; @grimm2020]. One effective strategy to address this issue is the development of open, specialized tools that enhance transparency and promote standardization, and reusability among researchers [@ram2019; @berger2024]. This is why `LogoClim` was created.

The `LogoClim` model was developed for seamless integration with other models through NetLogo's [`LevelSpace`](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/ls.html)  extension [@hjorth2020], which enables parallel execution and data exchange between models. This integration capability makes it particularly valuable for agent-based simulations that incorporate climate data to study ecological, environmental, or social processes affected by climate conditions.

While other programming languages, such as [R](https://www.r-project.org/), offer tools like the `geodata` package [@hijmans2024], there are currently no equivalent tools providing this functionality for NetLogo.

# Motivation

The model was originally developed as part of a project by the [Sustentarea](https://www.fsp.usp.br/sustentarea/) Research and Extension Center, aimed at evaluating the impact of climate change on the health and nutrition of Brazilian children under five years old [@carvalho2023a]. During development, however, we recognized that the model had broader potential beyond the scope of our study. `LogoClim` can now be used as a submodel within agent-based models designed to help researchers, policymakers, and practitioners explore the potential impacts of climate change across different contexts and geographical areas.

# How it works

`LogoClim` operates on a grid of patches, with each patch representing a geographic area and storing values for latitude, longitude, and selected climate variables. During simulation, patches update their colors based on the underlying data, enabling users to visualize spatial and temporal changes. The model interface also provides plots showing the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of the selected variable over time.

The model supports all three climate data series from [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/): long-term historical climate averages (1970–2000), historical monthly weather (1951–2024), and future climate projections (2021–2100). Each series is available at multiple spatial resolutions (from 10 minutes (~340 km² at the equator) to 30 seconds (~1 km² at the equator)), which can be selected within the model interface. Further details about each series are available on the WorldClim website.

The datasets are available for download from [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/), but must be converted to [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esri_grid#ASCII) format for compatibility with NetLogo. To simplify this workflow, we provide [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) notebooks with reproducible pipelines for downloading and processing the data. These notebooks can be customized to meet specific research needs.

We also provide example datasets for testing and demonstration. These files are available in the model's [OSF repository](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/RE95Z) and are ready to use with `LogoClim`. To illustrate how `LogoClim` can be used in practice, we also developed the [`Logônia`](https://github.com/sustentarea/logonia) model [@vartanian2025g], which showcases its integration into a full NetLogo simulation.
