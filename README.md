## Overview

This repository contains the files associated with the `LogoClim` model article, intended for submission to the *Journal of Open Source Software* ([JOSS](https://joss.theoj.org/)). LogoClim integrates climate data from [WorldClim 2.1](https://worldclim.org/) into [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), enabling the incorporation of real-world climate parameters into agent-based spatial models.
